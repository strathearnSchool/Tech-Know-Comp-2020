                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>The first rockets to reach space were V-2 rockets launched from Peenem√ºnde, Germany in 1944 during World War II. After the war,</p>
                <p>70 complete V-2 rockets were brought to White Sands for test launches, with 47 of them reaching altitudes between 100 km and 213 km.</p>
                <p>The world's first spaceport for orbital and human launches, the Baikonur Cosmodrome in southern Kazakhstan, started as a Soviet military</p>
                <p>rocket range in 1955. It achieved the first orbital flight (Sputnik 1) in October 1957. The exact location of the cosmodrome was initially</p>
                <p>held secret. Guesses to its location were misdirected by a name in common with a mining town 320 km away. The position became known in 1957</p>
                <p>outside the Soviet Union only after U-2 planes had identified the site by following railway lines in the Kazakh SSR, although Soviet</p>
                <p>authorities did not confirm the location for decades. The Baikonur Cosmodrome achieved the first launch of a human into space (Yuri Gagarin)</p>
                <p>in 1961. The launch complex used, Site 1, has reached a special symbolic significance and is commonly called Gagarin's Start. Baikonur was the primary</p>
                <p>Soviet cosmodrome, and is still widely used by Russia under a lease arrangement with Kazakhstan. In response to the early Soviet successes,</p>
                <p>the United States built up a major spaceport complex at Cape Canaveral in Florida. A large number of unmanned flights, as well as the early</p>
                <p>human flights, were carried out at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. For the Apollo programme, an adjacent spaceport, Kennedy Space Center,</p>
                <p>was constructed, and achieved the first manned mission to the lunar surface (Apollo 11) in July 1969. It was the base for all Space Shuttle</p>
                <p>launches and most of their runway landings. For details on the launch complexes of the two spaceports, see List of Cape Canaveral and Merritt Island launch sites.</p>
                <p>The Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana, is the major European spaceport, with satellite launches that benefit from the location 5 degrees north of the equator.</p>
                <p>In October 2003 the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center achieved the first Chinese human spaceflight. Breaking with tradition, in June 2004 on a runway</p>
                <p>at Mojave Air and Space Port, California, a human was for the first time launched to space in a privately funded, suborbital spaceflight,</p>
                <p>that was intended to pave the way for future commercial spaceflights. The spacecraft, SpaceShipOne, was launched by a carrier airplane taking off horizontally.</p>
                <p>At Cape Canaveral, SpaceX in 2015 made the first successful landing and recovery of a first stage used in a vertical satellite launch.</p>
