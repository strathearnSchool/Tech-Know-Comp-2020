                <p>The NASA introduced an Earth Observing System (EOS) composed of several satellites, science component, and data system described as the Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS).</p>
                <p>It disseminates numerous science data products as well as services designed for interdisciplinary education.</p>
                <p>EOSDIS data can be accessed online and accessed through File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS).</p>
                <p>Scientists and researchers perform EOSDIS science operations within a distributed platform of multiple interconnected nodes or Science</p>

                <h2>ESA</h2>
                <p>The European Space Agency have been operating Earth Observation satellites since the launch of Meteosat 1 in November 1977.</p>
                <p>ESA currently has plans to launch a satellite equipped with an artificial intelligence (AI) processor that will allow the spacecraft</p>
                <p>to make decisions on images to capture and data to transmit to the Earth. BrainSat will use the Intel Myriad X vision processing unit (VPU).</p>
                <p>The launching will be scheduled in 2019. ESA director for Earth Observation Programs Josef Aschbacher made the announcement during the PhiWeek in November 2018.</p>
                <p>This is the five-day meet that focused on the future of Earth observation. The conference was held at the ESA Center for Earth Observation in Frascati, Italy.</p>
                <p>ESA also launched the PhiLab, referring to the future-focused team that works to harness the potentials of AI and other disruptive innovations.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, the ESA also announced that it expects to commence the qualification flight of the Space Rider space plane in 2021.</p>
                <p>This will come after several demonstration missions. Space Rider is the sequel of the Agency's Intermediate Experimental vehicle (IXV)</p>
                <p>which was launched in 2015. It has the capacity payload of 800 kilograms for orbital missions that will last a maximum of two months.</p>

                <h2>SpaceX</h2>
                <p>SpaceX was scheduled to launch a multiple satellite mission on 28 November 2018 from the United States Vandenberg Air Force Base after an initial 19 November schedule.</p>
                <p>The launch is expected to be visible once the rocket heads toward the south into an Earth observation trajectory traveling over the opposites.</p>
                <p>However, the second supposed launched was delayed again because of poor weather conditions and the actual launch occurred on 3 December 2018.</p>
                <p>The mission is known as the SSO-A Smallsat Express was executed by Spaceflight, a rideshare and mission management provider based in Seattle, Wash.</p>
                <p>The launch was a landmark for Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX which had 19 rocket launches in 2018 alone. The estimated cost of this Falcon 9 rocket is approximately</p>
                <p>$62 million. The rocket has 60 satellites with each one going separate ways. On February 17, 2020, SpaceX launched their 5th constellation of</p>
                <p>60 Rockets, boosting the StarLink constellation to a total of 300 low orbit satellites.</p>

                <h2>Amazon and Lockheed</h2>
                <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Lockheed Martin entered into a strategic partnership for the purpose of integrating the AWS ground station service with</p>
                <p>Lockheed's verge antenna network. These two corporations aim to merge these highly-capable systems that will provide clients with robust satellite</p>
                <p>uplinks and downlinks. Through these systems, users can incorporate satellite data with various AWS services which include computing, storage,</p>
                <p>analytics, and machine-learning.
